# Misinformation Spread Simulation

A Pygame-based simulation modeling the spread of misinformation through agent interactions in different environments (home, work, social media). Agents transition between states like Susceptible, Exposed, Believer, Doubter, and Recovered based on interactions, skepticism, and environmental factors.

## Features

- Agent States: Susceptible, Exposed, Believer, Doubter, Recovered, Disinformant
- Time-Based Zones: Agents move between home, work, and social media zones based on real-world time (sleep, work hours, social media hours)
- Dynamic Interactions: Probabilistic state changes influenced by:
  - Emotional valence
  - Skepticism levels
  - Environmental factors (zone-dependent influence multipliers)
  - Disinformant manipulation
- Data Logging: CSV output tracking agent counts and environment states
- Visualization: Real-time statistics dashboard with agent counts and misinformed totals

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/misinformation-simulation.git
   cd misinformation-simulation

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows

3. Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Place agent images in an Images/ directory (optional for visual customization)

# Usage

## Run the simulation
python main.py

## Controls
1. Choose simulation duration (1 day or 1 week)
2. Set initial agent counts using sliders
3. Watch real-time spread dynamics:
  - Home zone agents cluster in grid cells
  - Work zone interactions during daytime
  - Social media spikes during morning/evening hours
  - Sleep periods (00:00-06:45) freeze movement

# Outputs
simulation_log.csv: Timestamped records of:
- Agent state counts
- Total misinformed agents
- Active environment
- Daily progression
